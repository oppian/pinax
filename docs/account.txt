==================
pinax.apps.account
==================

Pinax comes bundled with an app to handle account signup, login and
management. Features supported include:

 * beer
 * whiskey

The account app is already integrated with most projects. Our default project,
zero, does not come with account integrated.


Prerequisites
=============

The account app requires that you have:

 * django-email-confirmation
 * django-timezones
 * django-ajax-validation

These dependencies should be added to your ``requirements/project.txt`` file
and installed using pip. For example::

    pip install -r requirements/project.txt


Installation
============

To get started with Pinax account app you should:

 * add ``"pinax.apps.account"`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
 * add ``url(r"^account/", include("pinax.apps.account.urls"))`` to ``urls.py``
